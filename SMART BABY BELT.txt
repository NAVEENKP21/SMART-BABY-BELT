                                         SMART BABY BELT USING IOT
 
This project is to make sure to safeguard  our babies ,  women  And mentally retarded patients whenever   we miss them in a huge gathering crowd or they get abducted by kidnappers , 
since the device is already connected to the phone using wifi we can trace our infants or women we can trace them using the GPS tracking sensor in the device . 
this device is also used to monitor the body temparature for the babies as they cannot express their feelings if they suffer from fever , cold like us . 
using this baby belt we can reduce the infant mortality rate , assaults on infants and women we can reduce the crime rate in the society . 
water level sensor is also placed in this belt . 
if the carcass of the person using this belt  is thrown in to the sea or a lake , 
we can knew it easily using this water level sensor , 
it reduces the time of investigation and finding the carcass and makes work easier to the cops .
